# Dracula theme for DiscordRN mods

This is a theme following the dracula color scheme for Vendetta and Bunny/Pyoncord.
Might not work in older discord versions (since vendetta went EOL), WILL not work in Kotlin versions of discord.

If I missed anything or it's broken, do let me know, or feel free to make a pull request

## Installation

Go to Dracula.json, view as raw, copy the link, then go into your settings in Vendetta, themes and tap the + button, then paste the link if not there already to add it
